#### Explanation
#
#- **`EBook` Class:** Represents a book with attributes like title, author, and content. 
#        It provides methods to access these attributes.
#- **`User` Class:** Represents a user with login details and a list of purchased books. 
#        It provides methods for registration, login, and managing purchased books.
#- **`EBookReader` Class:** Manages the user's interaction with e-books, including buying, viewing, 
#        and reading books.
#- **`Store` Class:** Manages the list of books available for purchase and provides methods to 
#        list and find books.
#- **`Purchase` Class:** Represents a purchase transaction, linking a user and a book with the 
#        purchase date.
#
#This architecture allows for flexibility and separation of concerns, enabling easy extension 
#and maintenance of the e-book reader software.
