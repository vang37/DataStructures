# DataStructures
DS&amp;A in Python.

NOTE: Alternate--and sometimes optimized--solutions are included here and there. 
Generally, these solutions will be commented out. Said solutions might have slightly
different names, as well.

Also: I have taken care to reuse code now and again. Such usage means
that I am lazy and would like to reuse what I have written--in doing this,
I am by no means staking a claim to optimality.
